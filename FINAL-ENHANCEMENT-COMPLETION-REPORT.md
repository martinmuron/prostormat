## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK

### 93 Venues Still Need Enhancement

**Reasons for incompletion:**
1. **Invalid IDs** (~109 venues) - Venues with old/duplicate database IDs that no longer exist
2. **No website data** - Some venues without valid websites or scrapable content
3. **Duplicate entries** - Same venue with multiple IDs in different batches

**Recommendation:**
- Manually review the 93 remaining venues
- Check for duplicates or outdated entries
- Clean up invalid database records
- Re-run enhancement for valid venues only
