## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Image Upload (Your Task)
Now that all venues are created in the database, you can:
- Add images to `/prostory_images/` folders
- Use the venue slugs from the database
- Naming convention: `venue-slug/` for parent, `venue-slug_sub-location/` for children

Example structure:
```
prostory_images/
  ├── kafkoff/
  │   ├── image_1.jpg
  │   ├── image_2.jpg
  ├── space-cafe-hub-karlin/
  │   ├── image_1.jpg
  ├── space-cafe-hub-karlin_berlin-meeting-room/
  │   ├── image_1.jpg
```

### 2. Image Matching Script (Already Available)
Use existing scripts to upload images to Cloudinary and link to venues.

### 3. Review & Verification
- Check venue profiles on the frontend
- Verify parent-child relationships display correctly
- Ensure all data is accurate
