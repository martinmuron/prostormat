## üìä Current Status

### Database Statistics
- **Total venues**: 20 (existing + new)
- **New venues from scraping**: 2 (Dancing House Hotel, Alforno Pizza & Pasta)
- **Already existing**: 7 (Kafkoff, Bar Monk, etc.)
- **Prague venues**: 2 from new batch
- **Parent venues**: 20
- **Sub-locations**: 0 (not yet processed)

### Progress Metrics
- **Total URLs to process**: 1,129
- **URLs remaining**: 1,109
- **Progress**: 1.8%
- **Parent URLs**: 542 (not yet processed)
- **Sub-location URLs**: 587 (pending parent completion)

## üéØ Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Parent Venues (542 URLs)

```bash
# 1. Scrape 10-20 venues using Claude WebFetch
# 2. Compile into JSON batch file: /data/scraped-batch-N.json
# 3. Run batch processor:
npx tsx scripts/batch-scrape-venues.ts --batch=N

# 4. Check progress:
npx tsx scripts/check-scraping-progress.ts
```

### Phase 2: Sub-Locations (587 URLs)

Same process, but:
- Only start after ALL parents are complete
- Include `parentSlug` in JSON data
- System automatically links to parent via `parentId`

## üîë Key Features

### Prague Filtering
The system automatically filters venues by location:

**Included** (Prague area):
- Praha 1-22
- Karl√≠n, ≈Ωi≈ækov, Vinohrady, Sm√≠chov, Hole≈°ovice
- Mal√° Strana, Star√© Mƒõsto, Nov√© Mƒõsto
- All Prague districts and neighborhoods

**Excluded** (Non-Prague):
- Bratislava, Brno, Ostrava
- "Near Prague" locations outside city limits
- All non-Prague Czech cities

### Data Quality

Each venue includes:
- **Unique rewritten descriptions** - No plagiarism
- **Complete location data** - Address, district, postal code
- **Contact information** - Email, phone (when available)
- **Capacity details** - Seated and/or standing
- **Amenities** - Comprehensive lists
- **Web presence** - Website, Instagram (when available)

### Automation

The batch processor:
- ‚úÖ Automatically skips existing venues
- ‚úÖ Filters out non-Prague locations
- ‚úÖ Links sub-locations to parents
- ‚úÖ Sets all venues to 'active' status
- ‚úÖ Validates required fields
- ‚úÖ Provides detailed logging

## üìà Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

1. **Process next 10-15 parent venues** (Batch 2)
   - Continue with URLs from line 100-115 in prague_urls.txt
   - Focus on confirmed Prague venues
   - Verify Prague filtering is working correctly

2. **Establish efficient workflow**
   - Set up regular scraping sessions (e.g., 2-3 batches per day)
   - Use spreadsheet to track progress
   - Document any recurring issues

3. **Quality control**
   - Verify each batch after import
   - Check descriptions for quality
   - Ensure amenities are comprehensive

### Medium-term Goals (Priority 2)

1. **Complete Phase 1** - All 542 parent venues
   - Estimated time: 35-40 batches
   - At 2 batches/day: ~20 days
   - At 5 batches/day: ~8 days

2. **Start Phase 2** - Sub-locations (587 URLs)
   - Only begin after Phase 1 is complete
   - Verify all parents exist in database
   - Process in same batch format

### Long-term Improvements (Priority 3)

1. **Automation Enhancement**
   - Consider Puppeteer/Playwright for automated scraping
   - OpenAI API for automatic description rewriting
   - Batch processing with retry logic

2. **Data Enrichment**
   - Add missing contact information
   - Upload venue images
   - Collect social media links
   - Add pricing information

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Manual review of random samples
   - User feedback collection
   - SEO optimization of descriptions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

# 1. Check current progress
npx tsx scripts/check-scraping-progress.ts

# 2. Read next URLs from file (lines 100-115)
head -115 "/Users/martinmuron/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/prague_urls.txt" | tail -15

# 3. Scrape venues using Claude WebFetch (see SCRAPING_GUIDE.md)

# 4. Create /data/scraped-batch-2.json

# 5. Process batch
npx tsx scripts/batch-scrape-venues.ts --batch=2

# 6. Verify
npx tsx scripts/check-scraping-progress.ts
```

## üí° Tips for Efficient Scraping

1. **Batch Size**: Start with 10-15 venues per batch
2. **Verification**: Always check batch before processing
3. **Prague Filter**: Double-check city/district for each venue
4. **Descriptions**: Rewrite thoroughly - no copy-paste
5. **Progress**: Use spreadsheet to track batches
6. **Break**: Take breaks between batches for quality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Prague Filter is Critical**
   - Always verify city/district
   - Set `isPrague: false` for non-Prague venues
   - Script will skip these automatically

2. **Description Rewriting is Mandatory**
   - Never copy-paste original descriptions
   - Rewrite in your own words
   - Keep same meaning and context
   - Maintain professional tone

3. **Parent-First Processing**
   - Complete ALL parent venues before sub-locations
   - Sub-locations require parent to exist
   - Script validates parent existence

4. **Data Completeness**
   - Some fields may be null (email, phone, etc.)
   - This is acceptable - collect what's available
   - Can be enriched later

## üìû Support

- Review `/SCRAPING_GUIDE.md`
- Check `/CLAUDE.md` for project context
- Use verification commands to debug
- Check Prisma schema in `/prisma/schema.prisma`
