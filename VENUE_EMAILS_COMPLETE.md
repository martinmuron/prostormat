## Methodology

### Phase A: Existing Data Extraction (85 venues)
- Extracted emails from existing `contactEmail` field (50 venues)
- Generated emails from existing `websiteUrl` field (30 venues)
- Fast processing: <1 minute

### Phase B: Web Search & Generation (802 venues)
- Performed web searches for venues without websites
- Found official websites via Google search
- Filtered out aggregator sites (booking.com, tripadvisor, etc.)
- Generated emails using pattern: `info@{domain}`
- For sub-venues (with @ notation), used parent venue domain
- Processing time: ~2-3 hours

---

## Data Quality

### Website Sources
- **Official venue websites**: Primary source for email generation
- **Parent venue domains**: Used for sub-venues (rooms, spaces within larger venues)
- **Domain patterns**: For venues where official site couldn't be found

### Email Format
- **Standard pattern**: `info@{domain}.cz`
- **Clean domains**: Removed www, http/https, paths
- **Czech TLD preference**: .cz domains prioritized

### Notable Venue Groups

**Large venue complexes with multiple sub-venues:**
- Hard Rock Cafe Praha (4 sub-venues)
- Mama Shelter Prague (18 sub-venues)
- FLEKSI (21 sub-venues across 3 buildings)
- LobkowiczkÃ½ palÃ¡c (11 sub-venues)
- BÅ™evnovskÃ½ klÃ¡Å¡ter (10 sub-venues)
- Academic Congress Centre (8 sub-venues)

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Import
Update the Supabase production database:

```sql
-- Backup current data
CREATE TABLE prostormat_venues_backup AS SELECT * FROM prostormat_venues;

-- Import CSV (via Supabase dashboard or psql)
-- Then update venues:

UPDATE prostormat_venues v
SET
  "websiteUrl" = csv.website,
  "contactEmail" = csv.email
FROM venue_emails_import csv
WHERE v.slug = csv.slug
  AND (csv.source = 'web_search' OR csv.source = 'extracted_from_url');
```

### 2. Validation (Recommended)
Manually verify emails for high-priority venues:
- Top 50 most viewed venues
- Large venue complexes
- Premium listings

### 3. Email Verification (Optional)
Use email verification service to check deliverability:
- Hunter.io
- ZeroBounce
- NeverBounce

### 4. Feature Integration
Use emails for:
- Venue inquiry forms
- Direct booking requests
- Marketing campaigns
- Venue manager outreach
